Top 5 new desireable features:

I wrote these in the word doc submitted but here is a recap: 

Latent need: Notifications for when classes / lectures are happening and links / a way to access lectures quickly from the app, specially during these times structure is essential. 

A latent need for example that would accomplish this could be having quick access to upcoming deadlines front and center / hold in the home page, and making the process of contacting a professor / advisor a lot easier through the app, ie making the process of sending an email much easier by adding an email option to the course page so they can click and go right to the email to send. 

Another latent need would be being able to get to lecture right away from the notification sent out to the user, they tap on it and it redirects them to the lecture in whatever video call app the school may be using

Another new design functionality that has the potential to benefit would be the ability for students to favourite certain topics or content / assignments they might want to focus on when studying, such as when making a to-do list but its just the course content, so when you're wstudying for an exam and when you're finished revising a topic you can "check it off"
